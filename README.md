# Aloy
Aloy is the new API which is going to run the new Devscorch 4.0 platform. The API is going to be written in Swift with Vapor 4 and will have most of the functionality which you can expect from a LMS API. 

The whole idea is as followed:

The Frontend is going to be build in React for web visitors and the iOS, iPadOS, TvOS and MacOS apps are going to be build using SwiftUI. 

Aloy is going to get support for some of the following functionality:

- Create video courses with free or Subscription Model. 
- Create Podcasts with free or subscription models. 
- Create free articles and guids which are written
- New Content management system in the backend

The API is going to use 2 PostgreSQL databases which use Websockets for real time data transfers.
