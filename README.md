# Aloy
Aloy is the new API which is going to run the new Devscorch 4.0 platform. The API is going to be written in Swift with Vapor 4 and will have most of the functionality which you can expect from a LMS API. 

The whole idea is as followed:

The Frontend is going to be build in React for web visitors and the iOS, iPadOS, TvOS and MacOS apps are going to be build using SwiftUI.
